# 🌍 Decentralized Supply Chain Transparency Platform

Welcome to a revolutionary platform for transparent, traceable, and ethical supply chains! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project ensures products are authentic, ethically sourced, and compliant with community-driven transparency standards.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Product Traceability**: Track products from origin to final sale with immutable records.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Counterfeiting**: Verify product authenticity using unique hashes.
- 🌱 **Ethical Compliance**: Ensure products meet DAO-governed transparency indices (e.g., fair trade, sustainability).
- 📦 **Logistics Tracking**: Record production, distribution, and retail stages on-chain.
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance**: Community-driven updates to transparency standards via a DAO.
- ✅ **Consumer Verification**: Allow consumers to verify product authenticity and history.
- 🚫 **Tamper-Proof Records**: Prevent unauthorized changes with blockchain immutability.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Producers
1. Register a product with a unique hash, origin details, and production data.
2. Submit ethical compliance data (e.g., fair trade certification, carbon footprint).
3. Use the `product-registry` contract to store data on-chain.

### For Distributors/Retailers
1. Update product status (e.g., shipped, received, sold) using the `logistics-tracker` contract.
2. Ensure compliance with transparency indices via the `compliance-verifier` contract.

### For Consumers
1. Query product details using the `product-verifier` contract to confirm authenticity and history.
2. Access transparency scores via the `transparency-index` contract.

### For DAO Members
1. Propose and vote on transparency index updates (e.g., new sustainability metrics) using the `dao-governance` contract.
2. Stake tokens to participate in governance via the `staking` contract.
3. Claim rewards for governance participation using the `rewards` contract.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

1. **product-registry.clar**: Registers products with unique hashes, origin, and production details.
2. **logistics-tracker.clar**: Tracks product movements across the supply chain.
3. **compliance-verifier.clar**: Verifies compliance with DAO-governed transparency indices.
4. **transparency-index.clar**: Stores and updates transparency metrics and scores.
5. **dao-governance.clar**: Manages DAO proposals and voting for transparency standards.
6. **staking.clar**: Handles token staking for DAO participation.
7. **rewards.clar**: Distributes rewards to DAO members for governance contributions.
8. **product-verifier.clar**: Allows consumers to verify product authenticity and history.

### Usage
- **Producers**: Call `register-product` in `product-registry.clar` with product hash, origin, and compliance data.
- **Distributors/Retailers**: Use `update-status` in `logistics-tracker.clar` to log supply chain events.
- **Consumers**: Query `verify-product` in `product-verifier.clar` to check product details.
- **DAO Members**: Submit proposals via `propose-update` in `dao-governance.clar` and stake tokens using `stake-tokens` in `staking.clar`.

## 🔐 Security
- **Immutable Records**: All data is stored on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof records.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized principals (e.g., producers, DAO members) can call specific functions.
- **Transparency**: All actions are publicly verifiable via the blockchain.

## 🌟 Example Workflow
1. A coffee producer registers a batch with a SHA-256 hash, origin (e.g., Ethiopia), and fair trade certification.
2. A distributor updates the batch status as "shipped" and "received."
3. A retailer marks the batch as "sold."
4. A consumer scans a QR code to verify the coffee’s origin and ethical compliance.
5. The DAO proposes a new transparency metric (e.g., water usage) and votes to update the index.
